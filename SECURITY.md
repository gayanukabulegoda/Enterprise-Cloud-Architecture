## üîê Security Best Practices

To maintain a secure development and deployment environment:

1. **Secrets Management**
   * Never commit credentials or secrets to Git.
   * Use `.env` files locally and environment variables or cloud secret managers (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager) in production.
   * Use IAM roles with least privilege for cloud resources.

2. **Dependency Management**
   * Regularly update dependencies (`npm`, `Maven`, `Docker images`).
   * Run security audits:
     ```bash
     npm audit
     mvn dependency-check:check
     docker scan <image>
     ```

3. **Network & Access Controls**
   * Restrict service access with firewalls, VPCs, or security groups.
   * Enable TLS/HTTPS for frontend and API endpoints.
   * Use strong passwords and rotate them periodically.

4. **Data Security**
   * Store sensitive data in managed databases with encryption at rest & in transit.
   * For media-service, prefer S3/GCS with pre-signed URLs rather than public access.
   * Ensure backups are encrypted and stored securely.

5. **Container & Cloud Security**
   * Scan Docker images for vulnerabilities.
   * Keep container base images updated.
   * Enable logging, monitoring, and alerting on cloud resources.
